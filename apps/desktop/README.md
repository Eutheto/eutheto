# @eutheto/desktop — Phase 01 development desktop

This package is the non-public Tauri/Vue development application for the
[Phase 01 core application shell and persistence](../../docs/roadmap/01-core-application-shell-and-persistence.md).
It exercises the real local Rust application service; it is not a mock shell,
a packaged release, or evidence that the public application identity is
complete.

## Implemented development behavior

At startup, Tauri opens one `EuthetoApp` service backed by
`library.sqlite3` in the platform application-data directory. Rust and SQLite
are authoritative. The Vue application loads projections from that service and
sends typed requests back to it; browser state is not a second persistence
layer.

The current `ProjectHome` surface supports:

- listing persisted active and archived projects;
- creating an `official.test` project with explicit locale, time zone, horizon,
  units, and daylight-saving gap/overlap policies;
- selecting, duplicating, archiving, unarchiving, and permanently deleting a
  project;
- previewing and applying project imports, including an explicit action for
  each identifier collision;
- previewing and creating full-library backups; and
- previewing restores in add-to-library or replace-library mode, reviewing
  collisions, and explicitly confirming the destructive replacement path.

The Rust command boundary and generated client also implement project export
preview and creation. The current `ProjectHome` component does not expose
export controls, so export is API scope rather than a claim about the visible
home screen.

Generic scenario views, validation, command application, history, undo/redo,
and local settings are available through the Phase 01 command boundary. The
present Vue surface is a project home, not a domain planning or solution UI.

Solve, solution, and AI command names are registered in the stable command
catalog, but they are deliberately unavailable. `app_get_capabilities` reports
them as unavailable, and calls return typed `unsupported` errors. The desktop
does not advertise solver or AI availability.

## Rust-authoritative flow

```text
ProjectHome.vue
    │
    ▼
project-home.ts
    │ typed generated functions
    ▼
src/api/generated.ts
    │ Tauri invoke
    ▼
src-tauri/src/lib.rs
    │
    ▼
EuthetoApp ── SQLite library
```

The application-data database is the durable project authority. Portable
imports and exports use the managed local exchange area, while backups use the
managed backup area. Portable operations preview their artifact before
mutation. A replace-library restore requests a safety backup before replacing
the current library.

## Generated API-only Tauri imports

[`ADR-012`](../../docs/adr/012-tauri-api-and-generated-dtos.md) defines the IPC
boundary. In production frontend source,
`src/api/generated.ts` is the only file that imports
`@tauri-apps/api/core`. Vue components and controllers consume its typed
functions instead of importing `invoke` directly.

`src/api/generated.ts` is generated from the Rust-owned command and DTO
contract and is checked in. Do not edit it by hand:

1. Change the authoritative Rust DTO or command definition.
2. Run `just generate`.
3. Review the generated diff.
4. Run `just generate-check` to reject drift.

See
[generated code discipline](../../docs/contributors/generated-code-and-contracts.md)
and [generated artifacts](../../docs/architecture/generated-artifacts.md).

## Capability and release boundary

The local `main` window receives the `allow-phase-01-api` permission. The
permission admits the registered protocol catalog, while
`app_get_capabilities` remains the authority for which registered commands are
implemented in this development phase. No shell or broad filesystem permission
is granted to the webview.

The configured content security policy permits local application resources and
Tauri IPC; it does not permit remote scripts or remote navigation. Tauri
bundling is disabled, and the repository desktop build uses `--no-bundle`.
There is no supported packaged-desktop E2E command.

## Development identity and portable-extension notices

These values are explicit development values, not public compatibility or
release commitments:

| Value                                | Current use                                     | Status                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev.eutheto.phase01.desktop`        | Tauri application identifier                    | Development-only; not the approved public reverse-domain identifier                                     |
| `eutheto Phase 01 development shell` | Tauri product name and main-window title        | Development-only; not a release brand                                                                   |
| `0.1.0`                              | Workspace and Tauri version                     | Development version; not a released desktop version                                                     |
| `.eutheto`                           | Portable scenario and backup artifact extension | Proposed and reported by the API as `provisional-development-only`; not a final public file association |

The stable/beta application identifiers, final portable extension, signing
identities, updater trust, and packaged-release evidence remain open gates.
See [identity gates](../../docs/architecture/identity-gates.md).

## Development commands

Run these commands from the repository root. The `just` recipes are the
canonical repository entry points.

| Task                                                | `just` command                     | Direct pnpm command                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Run the native Tauri development application        | `just desktop-dev`                 | `pnpm --filter @eutheto/desktop run tauri dev`               |
| Run only the Vue/Vite development server            | `just ui-dev`                      | `pnpm --filter @eutheto/desktop run dev`                     |
| Type-check the frontend                             | `just typecheck`                   | `pnpm --filter @eutheto/desktop run typecheck`               |
| Run desktop ESLint                                  | `just lint` (repository-wide)      | `pnpm --filter @eutheto/desktop run lint`                    |
| Check desktop Prettier output                       | `just fmt-check` (repository-wide) | `pnpm --filter @eutheto/desktop run format:check`            |
| Run the UI unit/component tests                     | `just test-ui`                     | `pnpm --filter @eutheto/desktop run test`                    |
| Build the Vue frontend                              | `just ui-build`                    | `pnpm --filter @eutheto/desktop run build`                   |
| Build the native desktop executable without bundles | `just desktop-build`               | `pnpm --filter @eutheto/desktop run tauri build --no-bundle` |

API generation is Rust-owned: use `just generate` and
`just generate-check`, which invoke the corresponding `cargo xtask` commands.

The native development application requires the pinned Rust toolchain and
platform prerequisites described in
[development setup](../../docs/contributors/development.md). The Vite-only
server does not provide the native Tauri/Rust service.
