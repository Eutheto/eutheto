# eutheto implementation roadmap

This directory is the implementation source of truth for **eutheto**, a local-first, open-source constraint-optimization platform. It replaces the working project placeholder used by the source blueprint. The sequence is dependency-driven, not calendar-driven: a phase exits only when every stated gate passes. Architecture, data-integrity, security, accessibility, licensing, and compatibility requirements are release constraints rather than optional polish.

## Authority and unresolved product gates

The final project name and Rust/npm namespace are `eutheto`: Rust crates use `eutheto-*`, npm packages use `@eutheto/*`, repository paths and examples use `eutheto/`, and serialized project-owned media types use the `eutheto/...` namespace. The following are deliberately **not** inferred from the project name and must be resolved by an ADR before their first public use:

- working CLI executable name: `optimizer`;
- reverse-domain desktop application identifiers, including distinct stable/beta identifiers;
- portable project file extension (`.eutheto` is the current proposal, but is not final until its ADR closes);
- Git hosting organization and canonical repository URL;
- governance and private security-reporting contacts;
- code-signing/notarization identities, custody, rotation, protected environments, and release-signing/attestation choices.

Until each gate closes, documents may use `optimizer` only as an explicitly labelled working example and `.eutheto` only as a proposed extension. No public schema, installer, updater channel, shell integration, or file association may freeze them accidentally.

The source-of-truth order is:

1. security and data-integrity invariants in approved ADRs;
2. current scenario/protocol schemas and conformance tests;
3. this roadmap and domain specifications;
4. generated documentation;
5. incidental code comments.

Resolve conflicts by changing the authoritative source and its tests together. [assumptions.md](assumptions.md) records dated version/evidence decisions; it never replaces a requirement in a phase file.

Cross-cutting roadmap contracts complement the numbered phase files: [Performance and Solver UX Targets](performance-and-solver-ux-targets.md) defines provisional latency, budget, progress, and benchmark policy; [Portable Data, Backup, and Result Sharing](portable-data-backup-and-sharing.md) defines implementation-independent bundle, import/restore, and privacy-filtered report boundaries. Each contract identifies the phase that owns implementation and release evidence.

## Product vision

Build a general-purpose, human-friendly planning platform in which ordinary users describe what **must** happen, what they **prefer**, and which trade-offs matter, then receive understandable, verifiable, editable plans. The system is a headless optimization platform with an excellent desktop client, not optimization logic buried inside Tauri.

Every design must continue to pass both tests:

1. deleting the Tauri UI leaves an exceptionally useful headless framework;
2. a person who knows no constraint programming can solve a legitimately difficult problem in the desktop application.

The platform comprises:

- a fast Rust core for scenario commands, validation, routing, solve orchestration, independent verification, explanations, persistence, import/export, a reusable library API, and a first-class CLI;
- a Tauri 2 desktop client using Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite;
- domain packs that translate workforce scheduling, individual-seat event seating, school timetabling, planned post-MVP household transportation, and future problem families into a solver-neutral planning IR;
- an optional provider-neutral AI interface that can act only through typed, validated, reviewable, reversible application commands.

The public MVP contains production workforce and event-seating packs, bundled OR-Tools CP-SAT workers for supported platforms, experimental Pumpkin only for proven-compatible subsets, local persistence, proposed `.eutheto` editable scenario export/import and full-backup/add-or-replace restore, immutable privacy-filtered offline HTML/PDF result sharing, undo/redo/repair/comparison/explanations, optional BYOK/local AI with preview-and-apply changes, cross-platform artifacts, examples, notices, SBOMs, checksums, and signed update metadata. School timetabling is the first major post-MVP pack and influences foundation contracts without delaying the MVP. [Phase 14](14-transportation-domain-pack.md) is the detailed proposed post-MVP plan for household transportation; it is not current product behavior and selects no calendar, routing, or transit provider.

## Product principles

- **Human language before solver language.** Say “Required,” “Preference,” and “minimum rest after call”; reserve solver terminology for an advanced inspector.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Guided choices and safe defaults lead; advanced modeling appears only when needed.
- **Deterministic core; optional AI.** Validation, compilation, solving, verification, persistence, scoring, and deterministic explanations are application functions. AI is neither source of truth nor solver.
- **Local-first.** Create, edit, solve, and inspect without accounts or cloud services. Local storage is the default.
- **Human control and plan stability.** AI writes are visible proposals; all applied changes use the normal command API, are undoable, and honor revisions. A user can hard-lock what must remain, express softer preferences, and reflow from an accepted plan while explicitly minimizing avoidable disruption. A hard lock is never silently weakened.
- **Verifiability over trust.** Backend claims never make a candidate publishable; original domain meaning is independently evaluated.
- **Explanations and recovery are product behavior.** “No solution” alone is insufficient. Report validation issues and, where evidence permits, sufficient conflicting required rules in domain language. Proposed repairs identify the exact compromise, require explicit review, and apply only through reversible commands; deterministic evidence remains useful without AI.
- **Open architecture without premature generalization.** Stable contracts first; no dynamic native plugins, arbitrary DSL, unsafe code loading, marketplace, or generic workflow engine in the MVP.
- **Comparison before judgment.** Compare accepted plans and revisions semantically—changed decisions, verified score/category deltas, lock preservation, affected entities, and proof status—rather than presenting a raw data diff or an unexplained universal quality score.
- **Preserve and share deliberately.** Editable scenarios, full-library backups, and immutable offline result capsules are distinct artifacts. Sharing starts from an accepted sanitized presentation model, shows an exact privacy preview, and remains useful without an account, server, or network.
- **Beautiful means clear.** Calm, legible, fast, accessible, restrained interfaces—not an unrelated-card dashboard.

## Goals

- One installer per supported platform; no separate Python, Java, Rust, Node.js, OR-Tools, or solver installation.
- Equivalent optimization through the Rust library, working CLI, and desktop application.
- Workforce scheduling with clinic/on-call coupling, eligibility, availability, coverage, overlap, rest, fixed/rolling hours, consecutive work, skill mix, travel, fairness, preferences, locks, and repair.
- Individual-seat event seating with deterministic integer geometry, table/seat adjacency, orientation, physical proximity and distance, accessibility, same/different table, exclusions, and locks.
- Planned post-MVP household transportation with calendar-derived commitments, vehicle/driver coordination, carpools, pickups, drop-offs, strict no-transit-first solving with per-person opt-in transit fallback, and independent verification.
- Solver-neutral planning representation and stable routing to OR-Tools, Pumpkin, native algorithms, and future reviewed backends.
- Independent verification and authoritative score recomputation for every accepted candidate.
- Domain-language explanations for validation, infeasibility, assignment, trade-off, comparison, and repair changes.
- Lock, prefer, move, and repair/reflow interactions that preserve an accepted-plan baseline, minimize unnecessary change, summarize what changed, and retain the prior accepted result.
- Previous-versus-current semantic comparison plus reliable pack-owned buffer/tightness indicators where the domain can calculate them without false precision.
- Optional provider-neutral AI with BYOK and compatible local endpoints.
- Domain packs independent of OR-Tools, Pumpkin, persistence, network providers, and desktop implementation.
- Permissive official distribution with complete third-party notices and release SBOMs.

## Explicit MVP non-goals

- multi-user real-time collaboration or a hosted SaaS backend;
- mobile applications;
- a dynamic third-party marketplace or untrusted native libraries;
- arbitrary user-authored solver code or a universal untrusted expression DSL;
- guaranteed global optimality for every size;
- automatic decomposition of tightly coupled models across solvers;
- unofficial consumer OAuth or browser-cookie reuse;
- payroll, clinical, legal, labor-law, or regulatory certification;
- automatic authoritative interpretation of regulations;
- complete school timetabling in the first public MVP.

## Success criteria

### Engineering

- Core and CLI build/test independently of Tauri.
- A UI-created scenario exports, solves in the CLI, and imports with equivalent meaning and results.
- No accepted solution violates any required rule under the independent verifier.
- Desktop forms, imports, CLI, and AI use the same transactional, revisioned command API and undo/redo journal.
- Worker absence, mismatch, malformed output, crash, timeout, or cancellation cannot corrupt scenarios or crash the desktop process.
- Unsupported backends are blocked by an exact compatibility report before solving.
- Database, bundle, Portable Scenario, Result, Share Result, pack, and protocol migrations preserve every supported format and reject unknown required semantics safely.
- Fresh-install full-backup restore, add/replace recovery, collision handling, malicious archive rejection, and atomic failure behavior pass permanent fixtures.
- One-file HTML and direct PDF are built only from accepted immutable results and the exact privacy preview; core meaning works from `file://` with no network and accessible list/table parity.
- Primary workforce and seating flows are keyboard-complete.
- The application remains fully useful with AI disabled.
- Representative warm and cold solves meet the calibrated [performance and solver UX targets](performance-and-solver-ux-targets.md), preserve UI responsiveness, and report limit/proof status accurately.

### Product

A first-time user can create a workforce scenario, add/import people, define work and coverage, add required rules and preferences through plain-language guided controls, validate and optimize, understand whether requirements passed and why an assignment occurred, recognize reliable pack-owned buffers or tight points, lock a decision they value, change another decision and reflow without needless reshuffling, compare the revised plan with the prior accepted plan, and receive actionable reviewed guidance when a requested plan cannot work. They can also distinguish editable export from full backup and immutable sharing, restore safely, and create a privacy-reviewed offline result capsule—without learning operations-research terminology.

## Approved architecture decisions

These decisions remain approved until superseded by a numbered ADR with context, alternatives, consequences, status, and supersession links.

| ID | Binding decision |
|---|---|
| ADR-001 | The optimization core is a reusable Rust library with a headless CLI; Tauri is a client. |
| ADR-002 | Desktop uses Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite; Nuxt is reserved for the future docs/site app. |
| ADR-003 | Project code is Apache-2.0 and contributions initially use DCO sign-off, not a CLA. |
| ADR-004 | OR-Tools CP-SAT is the stable primary backend in a bundled native worker process. |
| ADR-005 | Pumpkin is an in-process Rust backend labelled experimental until compatibility, cancellation, packaging, and benchmark gates pass. |
| ADR-006 | Domain packs compile to solver-neutral planning IR and never construct backend objects. |
| ADR-007 | Every accepted solution is independently verified against the original domain scenario. |
| ADR-008 | MVP routing chooses one backend for a connected model and splits only mathematically and semantically independent components; cross-solver decomposition is post-MVP. |
| ADR-009 | Official MVP packs are compiled in. Future third-party packs use a sandboxed WASM/component model, not native dynamic libraries. |
| ADR-010 | SQLite is the local source of truth; credential values are stored only in the OS credential store. |
| ADR-011 | Scenario mutation uses typed commands, batches, inverses, periodic snapshots, and undo/redo—not distributed event sourcing. |
| ADR-012 | Tauri exposes coarse-grained commands and generated checked-in TypeScript DTOs; Rust owns authoritative scenario state. |
| ADR-013 | AI reads bounded context and proposes typed commands; it cannot bypass validation, write arbitrary files, run arbitrary commands, or generate solver source. |
| ADR-014 | BYOK and local endpoints are MVP authentication; OAuth is allowed only when a provider officially supports suitable third-party authorization. |
| ADR-015 | Nix Flakes are canonical for Linux/macOS development; native pinned Windows tooling/CI is authoritative for WebView2, sidecars, installers, and signing. |
| ADR-016 | Releases include checksums, SPDX SBOM, solver/version manifests, and third-party license notices. |
| ADR-017 | Time has an explicit scenario IANA zone and DST policy; solver quantities use checked integer units. |
| ADR-018 | The public external representation is eutheto's versioned scenario document/bundle, never an OR-Tools or MiniZinc model. |

## System architecture and dependency direction

```text
Clients: Vue/Tauri | CLI | optional AI | future API
                         │
                 typed application API
                         │
Rust core: commands, persistence, domain registry, validation,
planning IR, routing, jobs, verification, explanations, import/export
             │                              │
 in-process reviewed backend       versioned worker protocol
 (Pumpkin/native algorithms)        OR-Tools CP-SAT worker
```

Layer order is presentation → thin Tauri adapter → application services → domain packs → planning core → backend adapters → infrastructure. Dependencies point inward:

- presentation knows application DTOs, never tables or solver APIs;
- Tauri knows application services; application services know domain/persistence interfaces;
- domain packs know pack API and planning IR, not solver implementations, Tauri, SQLite, credentials, or providers;
- backends know solver API and planning IR, not domain packs;
- AI knows typed commands/queries, not persistence or solver internals;
- verification knows original domain models and normalized solutions, never trusts backend status as rule evidence.

During an OR-Tools solve, the Tauri/Rust process owns Vue, core, SQLite, and optional in-process backends, and launches one worker child per solve. Per-solve lifetime supplies crash isolation, process-tree cancellation, version handshake, cleanup, and upgrade safety. A long-lived pool is post-MVP and must retain those properties.

Canonical solve flow:

1. capture immutable scenario revision $R$;
2. domain-validate $R$;
3. compile deterministic planning IR plus provenance/projection;
4. normalize and validate the IR;
5. fingerprint and route to a compatible backend;
6. consume candidate events;
7. project values to normalized domain assignments;
8. independently verify every required rule and recompute score;
9. expose only verified candidates;
10. atomically persist the best verified solution with revision, model hash, backend/adapter/protocol versions, seed, thread count, options, score vector, and verification report.

A failed solve never mutates the scenario. Worker missing/mismatch/early exit, malformed frame, unsupported primitive, timeout, cancellation, invalid model, crash, failed verification, stale scenario revision, or post-solve database write failure is a recoverable typed error. Solution persistence is a separate transaction after verification.

## Global invariants and stop conditions

Protect these invariants in every phase:

- Tauri is a client, not the optimizer; Rust owns authoritative state.
- Domain packs do not know backend APIs; backends do not know domain packs.
- Every mutation is typed, validated, transactional, revision-checked, durable, auditable, and reversible when semantics permit.
- Every solve is against an immutable revision; stale results are labelled and never silently applied.
- Every backend choice is capability-checked before execution.
- Every candidate remains untrusted until independent domain verification and authoritative score recomputation pass.
- “Optimal,” “feasible,” and conflict-minimality wording exactly matches evidence. A sufficient infeasibility set is never called minimal unless proven.
- User IDs are stable typed IDs, never display names, array positions, or database row IDs. Units, zones, DST policies, clocks, seeds, and resource limits are explicit.
- Canonical output and hashing have deterministic ordering; checked arithmetic rejects overflow before a backend.
- Unknown/newer schemas and protocols fail safely; unknown extension data is preserved where practical; public data is never silently lost.
- Secrets never enter Vue, logs, SQLite, exports, diagnostics, Nix derivations, repository files, or ordinary IPC responses.
- Imported files and bundles are untrusted and bounded; parses/migrations finish before one atomic commit.
- Portable data is a versioned implementation-independent schema, never a SQLite dump. Export writes the current schema; import migrates supported history and rejects unknown semantics before preview and one atomic commit.
- Editable scenario export/full backup and immutable result sharing are distinct. A self-contained report is built only from a privacy-filtered Share Result Model tied to an accepted result; it never defaults to the source scenario or requires a network/server.
- Every solve and nested fallback/diagnostic operation consumes one bounded parent budget; an unverified incumbent, provider call, AI response, or optimality proof never blocks access to an already verified result.
- AI is optional and cannot exceed typed command/query permissions or skip preview/apply.
- Official artifacts remain one-install and comply with the permissive license policy.
- Accessibility has equivalent keyboard/list paths; canvas is never the only representation.

Pause work and write an ADR before continuing if a rule cannot be independently verified; a backend needs domain-specific knowledge; UI needs direct database access; AI needs arbitrary file/code/shell access; a plugin needs native in-process loading; a dependency falls outside license policy; migration cannot preserve scenarios; decomposition cannot prove independence; packaging requires disabling a major security control; or correctness relies on undocumented provider/backend behavior.

```

The arrows are phase-entry gates, not merely suggested sequencing: transitive prerequisites remain mandatory where a later node names only its immediate predecessor. Within an entered phase, genuinely independent work packages may proceed in parallel after the contracts they consume are stable, but parallel preparation never waives an entry gate or permits an integration/exit claim early.

Phase 13 and Phase 14 are sibling post-MVP branches entered directly from completed Phase 12. Neither branch requires completion of the other.

After contracts exist, prefer complete thin paths—one person, one shift, coverage → compile → solve → verify → display → edit → undo—over horizontal mock layers. Add each official rule with schema/migration analysis, command DTO/validation, plain-language editor, fast/full validation, planning compilation, backend capability/translation tests, independent verification, provenance/explanation, appropriate AI schema, CLI/document example, edge/infeasible fixtures, user limitations, and model/benchmark review. Solver formulation alone is never “done.”

Use trunk-based development, short-lived branches, protected `main`, and tags from tested commits. Add schema/protocol compatibility fixtures with the change, not at release time. Cargo features are sparse and explicit (`backend-pumpkin`, reviewed future adapters, diagnostics, platform integrations); required public packs are normal-build features. Frontend experiments use a typed application feature registry, never ad-hoc local-storage flags.

## Shared definitions

| Term | Roadmap meaning |
|---|---|
| Scenario | User-owned planning project at a revision: entities, required rules, preferences, settings, and optional base solution. |
| Domain pack | One problem family's concepts, commands, validation, compilation, verification, views, explanations, imports/exports, metadata, fixtures, and optional official UI. |
| Domain model / Domain IR | Pack-specific normalized semantic representation after parsing/defaults. |
| Planning IR | Shared immutable solver-neutral Boolean/integer/interval representation. |
| Backend | Solver or exact specialized algorithm accepting supported planning IR and returning candidate values/evidence. |
| Worker | Separate native process isolating a backend such as OR-Tools. |
| Router | Deterministic capability/structure policy selecting a backend and execution plan. |
| Candidate | Raw backend values not yet independently verified. |
| Normalized solution | Backend-independent projected assignments using stable domain IDs. |
| Accepted/verified solution | Normalized solution whose required rules and authoritative score were recomputed successfully. |
| Required rule | Condition every accepted solution must satisfy (“hard constraint” only in internal advanced terminology). |
| Preference | Explicit bounded objective contribution that may remain unmet. |
| Score vector | Ordered domain-owned objective levels with category breakdowns for comparing verified solutions. |
| Provenance | Stable chain from domain fact/rule through planning/backend records to evidence and localized explanation. |
| Assumption | Boolean switch a compatible solver uses to report a sufficient conflicting set. |
| Infeasibility core | Sufficient active assumption/rule set that cannot all hold; not necessarily minimum. |
| Lock | Absolute preservation (hard) or high-priority stability preference (soft). |
| Repair | Re-optimization after changes while minimizing differences from a base solution. |
| Counterfactual | Temporary diagnostic solve forcing/forbidding a choice to measure feasibility or score effect. |
| Domain command | Typed, validated, reversible scenario mutation. |
| View model | Purpose-built UI/CLI response, not authoritative storage. |
| Bundle | Versioned, bounded portable archive of scenario meaning and permitted assets; `.eutheto` is the proposed public extension pending its identity ADR. |
| Portable Scenario Model | Strict implementation-independent semantic representation used inside portable bundles; separately versioned from SQLite/internal persistence. |
| Result Model | Immutable accepted output tied to one scenario revision, verification checksum, score, and reproducibility metadata. |
| Share Result Model | Versioned privacy-filtered presentation representation built from an accepted Result Model, not the source Scenario Model. |
| Result capsule | Product term for an immutable privacy-reviewed offline artifact rendered from a Share Result Model, initially standalone HTML or direct PDF; it is not an editable scenario, backup, or additional source-of-truth format. |
| Scenario Compare | Semantic comparison of recorded inputs, locks/preferences, accepted decisions, verified score categories, affected entities, and proof state—not a raw JSON/database diff. |
| Plan Health | Pack-owned typed evidence about buffers, tightness, dependencies, or criticality; never an unexplained cross-domain score or unsupported probability. |
| Restore | Consequential backup operation that adds to or atomically replaces portable library data under explicit preview, confirmation, and safety-backup policy. |
| Model hash | Canonical digest of planning meaning, versions, compiler/adapter, and relevant options. |
| Optimal | Backend proved no better result for its exact encoded objective under its proof semantics, and the candidate verified. |
| Feasible | A verified required-rule-compliant solution exists, without a proof of optimality. |

## Definition of done

A core feature documents contracts, returns typed actionable errors, tests boundaries/property invariants, handles serialization/versioning, considers cancellation/resources, emits structured redacted logs, passes Nix/native builds, and updates relevant docs/ADRs.

A domain rule additionally completes the full rule checklist, states unambiguous required/preference semantics and safe empty/default scopes, agrees between compiler/verifier on exhaustive small cases, includes boundary and infeasible cases, has readable result/explanation UX, survives import/export, rejects invalid AI shapes, and measures model-size impact.

A backend has approved license/distribution, visible pinned version, implemented compatibility matrix, contract tests for every claimed primitive, normalized status/cancel/timeout behavior, verified candidate projection, crash/malformed-output handling, target packaging smoke tests, benchmark comparison, and accurate stability label.

A desktop flow includes normal, empty, loading, stale, error, and offline states; keyboard and accessible focus/name/announcement behavior; safe optimistic/transient state; conflict and undo/redo semantics; large-fixture profiling; representative usability evidence; and current screenshots/help.

An AI capability has a deterministic non-AI equivalent, typed allowlisted risk-classified tools, preview/apply writes, stale-revision and injection/malformed-call tests, documented secret/data scope, state-safe provider failures, inspectable deterministic evidence, and a fake-provider CI path.
