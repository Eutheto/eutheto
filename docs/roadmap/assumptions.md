# Assumptions, Decisions, and Current-Version Ledger

## Ledger purpose and authority

This dated ledger records implementation-time facts, corrections, unresolved gates, and evidence. It does **not** replace requirements in the phase roadmaps. Requirements remain in the applicable phase file; this ledger answers “what was verified, what value controls, who closes the gate, and from which evidence?”

## Final and unresolved identity decisions

| Decision | Status/value | Owner/gate |
|---|---|---|
| Project name | **Resolved: `eutheto`** | Project-wide; Phase 0 records it everywhere |
| License/contribution | **Resolved: Apache-2.0 and DCO; no CLA initially** | Phase 0 legal files; Phase 11/12 compliance |
| Working CLI name | **Unresolved: `optimizer` is provisional, not final** | K.1 / Phase 0; must close before stable CLI docs and service mode |
| Crate/package namespace and prefixes | **Resolved: `eutheto` namespace prefix**; Rust crates use `eutheto-*` and npm packages use `@eutheto/*`. The exact crate/package inventory names remain Phase-0 initialization decisions. | K.1 / Phase 0 |
| Reverse-domain application ID | **Unresolved** | K.1 / Phase 0 and Phase 11 signing/updater |
| Portable file extension/media type/association | **Unresolved; `.eutheto` is the current proposal, not a public decision.** `.optplan` is no longer the working proposal. | Phase 11 identity ADR and Phase 12 cross-platform open/inspect/package evidence |
| Git hosting organization | **Unresolved** | K.1 / Phase 0 and Phase 11 release URLs |
| Governance/security contacts | **Unresolved**; do not fabricate addresses | K.1 / Phase 11 governance/security |
| Stable/beta application identifiers | **Unresolved** | K.1 / Phase 11 updater/signing continuity |
| Release signing/notarization/key custody | **Unresolved choices; required before release** | K.1/K.5/K.8 / Phase 11–12 |

## Cross-cutting proposal decisions

| Decision | Current status/value | Owner/gate |
|---|---|---|
| Performance targets | **Provisional engineering objectives, not public guarantees:** small warm <500 ms; typical warm target <1 s and usually <3 s cold; p95 normal <5 s; moderate majority <5 s and expected <10 s; bounded stress/pathological behavior. | [Performance and Solver UX Targets](performance-and-solver-ux-targets.md); Phase 12 calibrates public-MVP corpus/reference machine and Phase 14 recalibrates transportation. |
| Interactive solver budget | **Initial experiment:** approximately 2–3 s of CP-SAT within a 3–5 s end-to-end Balanced budget; Quick/Deep remain bounded and never imply proof. | Phases 02–08 implement one parent budget/status semantics; Phase 12 selects released defaults from evidence. |
| Performance reference hardware | **Provisional class:** ordinary 4–8-core, 16 GiB consumer machine, no dedicated GPU requirement. | Phase 12 records the exact machine, power mode, runner image, sample/percentile policy, corpus, cache state, and regression thresholds. |
| Portable compatibility policy | **MVP proposal:** internal SQLite/document storage is not interchange; current builds export only current canonical Portable Scenario/Result/Share Result schemas; released historical inputs migrate sequentially; unknown required semantics/newer versions fail before mutation; declared nonsemantic extensions preserve. | [Portable Data, Backup, and Result Sharing](portable-data-backup-and-sharing.md); Phases 01–02 implement contracts, 05/07/09 specialize official packs, 11–12 freeze/release. |
| MVP portable scope | **Scenario bundle plus full-library backup/restore:** stable IDs and canonical units; Create copy/Replace/Skip scenario collisions; Add/Replace full restore with attempted pre-restore safety backup; no semantic merge, encryption, automatic backup, signatures, or hosted service in MVP. | Phases 01/06 own services/UI; Phase 12 owns permanent migration, malicious-archive, atomicity, and fresh-install recovery evidence. |
| MVP result sharing | **One privacy-filtered immutable Share Result Model:** one-file offline `file://` HTML is default; direct PDF is secondary but required; exact preview drives both; zero required network; accessible list/table parity; accepted-result provenance. | Phases 07/09 implement shared renderer and official-pack payloads; Phases 11–12 close browser, CSP, privacy, print/PDF, and release evidence. |

## Controlling recommendations

| Item | Latest observed | Controlling recommendation | Reason and owner |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| nixpkgs | `nixos-unstable` snapshot identifies as 26.11 | **`nixos-25.11`** | The 26.11 unstable snapshot dropped `x86_64-darwin`, which Phase 00 still requires alongside the other three flake systems. `nixos-25.11` is the newest line verified compatible with that four-system evaluation contract, not a claim about the newest nixpkgs generally. Re-evaluate when a newer supported line restores `x86_64-darwin` or project support policy closes that target. |
| nixGL | `b6105297e6f0cd041670c3e8628394d4ee247ed5` | **Locked flake input following repository nixpkgs** | Non-NixOS Linux cannot use Nix-built WebKitGTK reliably with ambient Mesa/NVIDIA userspace. The canonical desktop recipe applies the locked Mesa wrapper automatically and performs host-version NVIDIA selection only when the explicit launch command runs. Phase 0 owns the development wrapper; Phase 11/12 separately owns packaged runtime evidence. |
| Rust | 1.98.0 | **1.97.1** | Rust 1.98.0 has a P-critical trait-object vtable miscompilation; re-evaluate when 1.98.1 or newer fixed stable exists and passes Phase 0/12 target suites. [Rust releases](https://blog.rust-lang.org/releases/) and [issue #161441](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/161441). |
| Node.js | 26.8.1 Current | **24.20.0 LTS** | Production uses current LTS; re-evaluate Node 26 when it becomes LTS. Phase 0 owns engines/Nix. [Node distributions](https://nodejs.org/dist/). |
| pnpm | 11.24.0 | **11.24.0** | Direct registry current stable supports Node `>=22.13`; replaces blueprint/report pnpm-10 guidance. Phase 0 owns lock/integrity and Nix availability. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm). |
| TypeScript | 7.0.2 | **6.0.3** | `typescript-eslint` 8.68.0 declares TypeScript `>=4.8.4 <6.1.0`; newest supported stable is 6.0.3. Phase 0 owns exact lock. [npm TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript), [typescript-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-eslint). |
| protobuf/protoc | 36.0 | **33.1, matched to OR-Tools 9.15** | OR-Tools tag `v9.15` pins protobuf `v33.1`; the locked four-system Nix toolchain exposes `protobuf_33` 33.1 and `libprotoc 33.1`. Do not blindly use newest protoc. Phase 3 owns generated-binding and C++ runtime conformance. [protobuf v33.1](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v33.1), [OR-Tools v9.15 dependency declaration](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/v9.15/cmake/dependencies/CMakeLists.txt). |
| OR-Tools | 9.15 | **9.15 after K.3 gates** | Platform build, benchmark, CMake, linkage, protocol, SBOM/license, callback, and assumption-core gates remain. Phase 3 owns pin; Phase 11/12 owns exact artifacts. [release](https://github.com/google/or-tools/releases/tag/v9.15). |
| Pumpkin | 0.5.0 | **0.5.0 after K.4 gates** | Actual support matrix, dedicated-thread ownership, cooperative cancellation/time limits, verifier/contracts, and benchmarks precede auto-routing. Phase 8 owns. [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pumpkin-solver). |

### Linux graphics runtime provenance

The `nixGL` input is locked to revision `b6105297e6f0cd041670c3e8628394d4ee247ed5` and follows the repository's `nixpkgs` input. Its verified wrapper contract is: `nixGLIntel` supplies Mesa for Intel, AMD, and Nouveau; `auto.nixGLDefault` chooses the proprietary NVIDIA wrapper when `/proc/driver/nvidia/version` identifies a loaded NVIDIA module and otherwise chooses Mesa. The automatic NVIDIA derivation is necessarily impure because its userspace version must exactly match the host kernel module; `just desktop-dev` defers that selection until the explicit launch so shell entry and non-desktop commands remain pure and side-effect-free.

The upstream NVIDIA download path is x86-64-only. The locked flake therefore supports the Mesa path on both Linux systems and proprietary NVIDIA only on `x86_64-linux`; a proprietary NVIDIA `aarch64-linux` desktop is not claimed. Sources reverified on 2026-08-29: [`nixGL` README](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL/blob/b6105297e6f0cd041670c3e8628394d4ee247ed5/README.md), [`flake.nix`](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL/blob/b6105297e6f0cd041670c3e8628394d4ee247ed5/flake.nix), and [`nixGL.nix`](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL/blob/b6105297e6f0cd041670c3e8628394d4ee247ed5/nixGL.nix).

### Node 24.20.0 Nix provenance

The locked `nixos-25.11` graph exposes Node 24.18.0, while `nixos-26.05`—the last release line exposing `x86_64-darwin`—exposes Node 24.19.0. Neither satisfies the exact Phase-00 Node 24.20.0 contract. Until nixpkgs catches up without dropping a supported system, `nix/tooling.nix` uses the official Node binary archives as fixed-output inputs and patches only the Linux ELF interpreter/runtime references through Nix.

The controlling hashes are the entries in Node's official [`v24.20.0/SHASUMS256.txt`](https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.20.0/SHASUMS256.txt), verified on 2026-08-29:

| Nix system | Official archive | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| `x86_64-linux` | `node-v24.20.0-linux-x64.tar.xz` | `2f2c0da162318f0de47665410c7c8c2ed3d36c8f3105de4bbc61176c70a7cbf2` |
| `aarch64-linux` | `node-v24.20.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz` | `5f4ddab610c1ab2016b3c227cebdbf6d9495161487e4739c7b90090595f465f7` |
| `x86_64-darwin` | `node-v24.20.0-darwin-x64.tar.xz` | `26fc30891004603d094eed11de5efcd03bbd2efbc35c177fc72648d5d7a7701b` |
| `aarch64-darwin` | `node-v24.20.0-darwin-arm64.tar.xz` | `b7bf7707070b950ba1ec5f1af3bb6de0f2b1962c5033973d94068ab021ef3014` |

Re-verify the filename/hash pairs against that official manifest whenever the selected Node patch changes. Re-evaluate and remove the binary-archive derivation when the locked nixpkgs graph supplies the exact selected Node version on all four supported systems; do not accept an older patch merely because it is the newest package in a compatible nixpkgs line.

### cargo-llvm-cov availability in locked nixpkgs

The locked `nixos-25.11` graph resolves `pkgs.cargo-llvm-cov` to `cargo-llvm-cov-0.6.20` and marks that derivation broken on both `x86_64-darwin` and `aarch64-darwin`. Nix therefore refuses to evaluate either macOS shell containing it. [`nix/tooling.nix`](../../nix/tooling.nix) excludes only that package on Darwin; both Linux systems retain it, including the Linux full shell used by CI. The default shell is unchanged.

The direct quality-tool selection remains `cargo-llvm-cov` 0.9.0. The portable CI matrix configures native locked-flake evaluation and default-shell realization for all four supported systems, with the macOS coverage omission above. Configuration alone does not prove exact-version parity, completed native macOS runners, or macOS coverage. Until the locked graph supplies the selected version on every supported system, this remains an explicit Phase-00 quality-tool exception rather than satisfying the exact 0.9.0 four-system tool contract. Linux CI is configured to run the canonical `just check` recipe, and macOS contributors can run coverage with the separately installed selected tool after completing the [native Xcode/SDK prerequisites](../contributors/macos.md#xcode-and-sdk-prerequisite).

Remove the Darwin omission only when a newly locked nixpkgs graph provides a non-broken `cargo-llvm-cov` at the selected version on all four systems. Re-run the all-system flake evaluation plus native coverage on each affected target before closing the exception.

### Phase-01 implementation limits and dependency evidence

The following implementation evidence was recorded on **2026-08-29** and controls Phase 01 until the named constants or dependency pins change:

- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` pins `tauri = 2.11.5` and `tauri-plugin-dialog = 2.7.2`, and the root `Cargo.lock` resolves that exact pair. The upstream [`dialog-v2.7.2` workspace manifest](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/blob/dialog-v2.7.2/Cargo.toml) declares `tauri = "2.10"`, whose Cargo-compatible 2.x range admits Tauri 2.11. This is controlling manifest/lock compatibility evidence, not packaged cross-platform dialog execution evidence.
- `.eutheto` remains only the proposed portable extension. The working `optimizer` CLI name, reverse-domain application ID, file association/media type, and other public identities remain unresolved; the implemented bundle formats and limits do not settle them.

`eutheto_export::PORTABLE_LIMITS` is the one production limit set shared by export and untrusted import:

| Boundary | Controlling value |
|---|---:|
| Archive bytes | 64 MiB (`64 * 1024 * 1024`) |
| Total uncompressed bytes | 64 MiB (`64 * 1024 * 1024`) |
| One entry | 16 MiB (`16 * 1024 * 1024`) |
| Entries | 4,096 |
| Compression ratio | 200:1 |
| UTF-8 path bytes | 240 |
| One JSON document | 16 MiB (`16 * 1024 * 1024`) |
| JSON nesting depth | 128 |
| One JSON string | 1 MiB (`1024 * 1024`) |
| Items in one JSON collection | 1,000,000 |

The CLI bounds command-file JSON reads at 16 MiB and bundle reads at the same centralized 64 MiB production archive ceiling. Desktop granted-file reads apply the same 64 MiB ceiling with one-byte overflow detection, require an opened regular file, and reject links and special files. Unix opens use `O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK` plus device/inode comparison. Windows resolves the selected path once with `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`, treats the returned handle as authoritative, rejects a final entry carrying `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT`, and reads that same handle without reopening the path. Intermediate directory reparse points participate in Windows path resolution and are not independently rejected; binding a native-dialog selection to a specific file across later path replacement would require the dialog boundary to return an open handle rather than only a path. The store's default periodic snapshot policy is every 50 committed commands, at most 16 MiB of document JSON, with zstd level 3. Accepted configured snapshot bounds are 1–10,000 commands, 1 byte–64 MiB per document, and zstd levels 1–19. Every SQLite connection runs `foreign_keys = ON` and a 5-second busy timeout, enables WAL plus `synchronous = FULL` during initialization, and uses `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` for mutation, migration, and restore transactions. Private database, WAL, SHM, safety-backup, and containing-directory paths are rejected if they traverse symlinks or Windows reparse points. On Unix they are restricted to the effective user with mode `0600`/`0700`; on Windows the owner SID must already be the current user, LocalSystem, or BUILTIN Administrators, after which inheritance is disabled, the owner is set to the current user, the DACL is replaced with one current-user `FullControl` rule, and that ACL is read back and verified. Existing private files must have one link on Unix and must not report `HardLink` on Windows. Existing ancestors are inspected without link traversal; Unix rejects ambient group/other write unless the sticky bit is set, while Windows rejects non-current-user, non-LocalSystem, non-Administrators effective allow rules granting `DeleteSubdirectoriesAndFiles`, ignoring inheritance-only ACEs that do not apply to the ancestor itself. Unsupported platforms fail closed. The Windows implementation uses non-interactive PowerShell/.NET security APIs and therefore requires Windows PowerShell compatibility. Blocking SQLite work runs through bounded `spawn_blocking` calls, and the application service serializes all store access. On successful startup, the application opens the configured database, verifies or initializes the schema, validates the audit chain plus current materialized document/revision state, verifies snapshots and rolls back only to a valid current-revision snapshot before otherwise failing closed, rebuilds authoritative projections, increments `startup_epoch`, writes `last_clean_shutdown = false`, records the exact `StartupRecoveryOutcome`, and exposes that outcome through application state for one native startup notification before acknowledgment. Graceful shutdown sets `last_clean_shutdown = true`. An unclean marker without corruption is retained in startup state and remains a notice rather than a destructive automatic repair.

Phase-01 portable previews are retained in native memory only, capped at three pending previews and 64 MiB of retained inspected data in total. Ordinary import accepts only `scenario-export`; add/replace restore accepts only `full-backup`; typed portable application settings and every supplemental collision identity are validated before a preview is retained. Apply, stale/conflicting apply, terminal failure, explicit cancellation, and eviction consume the preview without mutation. The sole exception is the first safe replace-library safety-backup failure: that failure retains the same preview and collision choices, exposes only its user-safe reason, and enables a second request with the exact phrase `REPLACE WITHOUT BACKUP`; a prospective phrase is rejected and consumed. Replace preview discloses exact project and supplemental removal scope at the bound library revision. The safety backup is assembled, published without clobbering, reopened, and verified before replacement. Scenario export and full backup are each assembled from one store snapshot, preserve portable capability/semantic/nonsemantic wrapper metadata, selected supplemental JSON, and exact inert asset media-type/redistribution declarations, and reject retained results whose exact scenario revision is not represented. Scenario export scopes retained records/assets to declared references for its one scenario. Both paths structurally omit unsupported or secret-bearing application settings; the public settings boundary accepts only typed `appearance`, `locale`, and `units` values. Every committed create, duplicate, scenario command, lifecycle action, portable apply/removal, and setting mutation publishes a request-correlated post-commit event; lag is retryable, Tauri requests authoritative refresh, and forwarding continues.

The `zip = 8.6.0` reader can collapse duplicate raw filenames before ordinary indexed inspection. The controlling defense is therefore to validate the raw ZIP32 central directory before constructing `ZipArchive`: reject duplicate raw names and duplicate normalized paths, inconsistent EOCD/count/offset/size records, ZIP64, multi-disk, encryption flags/fields, malformed extra fields, and then retain normalized and case-collision checks during bounded entry reads. Dependency-reader behavior alone is not the duplicate-path trust boundary.

Stable harness compilation and fuzz execution are separate evidence. On 2026-08-29, `cargo check --manifest-path crates/eutheto-import/fuzz/Cargo.toml --all-targets` passed, proving that stable Cargo can compile all targets in the nested harness manifest; that check alone does **not** prove a libFuzzer run. Separately, `nix develop .#full -c just fuzz-check` completed successfully with explicit rustup `nightly-2026-08-28` `FUZZ_CARGO`, `FUZZ_RUSTC`, and `FUZZ_RUSTDOC`. With `-seed=0 -jobs=1 -workers=1 -timeout=5 -max_total_time=30 -rss_limit_mb=4096`, `scenario_envelope` completed 145,840 runs in 31 seconds and `bundle` completed 2,644,047 runs in 31 seconds, with no crashes. The scenario target rejects inputs over 64 KiB; the raw-bundle target rejects inputs over 512 KiB and further caps total uncompressed data at 1 MiB, one entry at 256 KiB, entries at 128, compression ratio at 32:1, JSON at 256 KiB/depth 64/string 64 KiB/collection 4,096, and paths at 240 bytes. On 2026-08-31, the same bounded command completed all eight checked-in targets—`scenario_envelope`, `bundle`, `migration_chain`, `bundle_remap`, `planning_ir`, `integer_expression`, `projection`, and `component_graph`—for 30 seconds each against their checked-in seed corpora, with no crashes.

## Appendix K gate ledger

Every K item is represented below. “Version selected” does not mean the build/release evidence gate is closed.

### K.1 — Repository initialization

| Gate | Status on 2026-08-29 | Owner/closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Final project name | **Closed: eutheto** | Phase 0 workspace/package/docs normalization |
| Rust/npm namespaces and prefixes | **Closed: Rust `eutheto-*`; npm `@eutheto/*`** | Final project-wide namespace decision; Phase 0 normalizes workspace/package manifests |
| CLI executable, reverse-domain app ID, exact crate/package inventory names, portable extension/media types/file associations | **Open; `.eutheto` is the portable extension proposal** | Phase 0 committed names where needed; Phase 11 identity ADR/installer/CLI/docs; Phase 12 cross-platform open/inspect and migration/update compatibility |
| Hosting organization and governance contacts | **Open** | Phase 0/11 public repository, GOVERNANCE/SECURITY contacts |
| Exact Rust | **Selected and Nix-pinned: 1.97.1; four native CI default-shell assertions configured, run evidence pending** | `rust-toolchain.toml`, flake shell, and successful target-suite runs; revisit fixed stable |
| Exact Node/pnpm | **Selected and Nix-pinned: Node 24.20.0 and pnpm 11.24.0; four native CI default-shell assertions configured, run evidence pending** | official fixed-output hashes/package-manager integrity, Nix shell, and successful CI smoke |
| Tauri/Vue/Tailwind/shadcn/Reka/Lucide pins | **Current direct values recorded; lock open**, including mandatory direct `@pinia/colada` 1.4.2, `@vue/compiler-sfc` 3.5.42, `@vue/devtools-api` 8.2.1 and `@lucide/vue` 1.37.0 | Cargo/pnpm locks and desktop smoke |
| RustSec exceptions in the locked Tauri Linux graph | **Accepted until 2026-11-30:** sixteen exact unmaintained advisories in Tauri 2.11.5's GTK3/urlpattern transitives have no compatible maintained replacement; `RUSTSEC-2024-0429` is accepted only because the locked dependency sources contain no call to the affected `glib::VariantStrIter` path | `@Eutheto/maintainers`; exact IDs, rationale, and a UTC fail-closed expiry guard in `deny.toml`/`just rust-advisories`; re-review on every Tauri/lock change, any relevant advisory, by the expiry, and before Phase 11/public release |
| Stable/beta IDs | **Open** | Phase 11 updater/signing path continuity |
| Signing/notarization plan and protected environments | **Open** | Phase 11 documented key custody/rotation and protected-workflow evidence |

### K.2 — Nix

| Gate | Status | Owner/closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Verify `webkitgtk_4_1`, `libsoup_3`, app indicator, pnpm 11, exact Node 24.20.0, Syft, Cosign, and SLSA verifier | **Node/pnpm derivations and official Node hashes committed; native locked-flake/default-shell CI is configured for all four systems, with run evidence and remaining locked attributes still open**; app indicator qualified obsolete | Phase 0 `flake.lock`, native CI runs, and shells |
| Darwin shell/Xcode tools | **Native Intel and Apple Silicon shell lanes configured; successful run evidence pending** | Phase 0 macOS shell smoke on `macos-15-intel` and `macos-15` |
| nixfmt check invocation | **Configured: `nix flake check --no-update-lock-file` on every native Nix lane; successful run evidence pending** | Phase 0 portable workflow runs |
| Binary-cache plan | **Configured for the public `cache.nixos.org` substituter only; no project cache is claimed and run evidence is pending** | Phase 0 portable workflow and later project-cache ownership/trust decision |
| Fully packaged Linux desktop derivation vs dev/worker/CLI only | **Open** | Phase 0/11 artifact scope decision |

### K.3 — OR-Tools

| Gate | Status | Owner/closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Exact release/commit | **Pinned candidate: v9.15 at `551ad10d94835c99e5e1e684500d3db398c0e345`; all four MVP target source builds, primitive benchmarks, callback gates, and the measured linkage selection pass, while manifest/SBOM, packaging, and remaining K.3 gates still block production adoption** | Phase 3 target matrix runs `33577785073`, `33582692427`, `33587339469`, and `33590499388`; official release assets identify semantic build version `9.15.6755` |
| Source hash and proto checksums | **Recorded:** raw GitHub archive SHA-256 `6395a00a97ff30af878ee8d7fd5ad0ab1c7844f7219182c6d71acbee1b5f3026`; unpacked Nix hash `sha256-9+tvgP/+/VY6wu7lzTdP4xfiJIgPSLVR9lEdZjQCZkE=`; `cp_model.proto` SHA-256 `c967180600fab5db4fc8b7477fef56c3c6d3c0714b1f0355697f96d147f77d96`; `sat_parameters.proto` SHA-256 `9a5e08486a63414191870bd9953f9e561af221e165654913a33662bf1b674308`** | Phase 3 derivation, generated-proto, and manifest checks |
| Exact CMake disable flags | **Confirmed against the pinned source on Windows x86_64, macOS arm64/x86_64, and Linux x86_64** | Hosted source builds passed with language wrappers, examples/samples/tests/docs, GLPK, proprietary solvers, and unrelated solver components disabled; the production manifest must preserve the exact flags |
| CP-SAT worker-thread ceiling | **Confirmed: 10,000** | Pinned OR-Tools 9.15 [`parameters_validation.cc`](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/v9.15/ortools/sat/parameters_validation.cc) rejects `num_search_workers` above 10,000; `protocol/version.json` is the runtime authority and may impose a lower product limit later |
| Pre-pin primitive benchmarks | **Passed on every MVP target:** nine outcome-sensitive fixtures cover the Phase 03 Boolean, cardinality, integer-linear, reification/enforcement, bounded penalty/reward objective, and projection encodings under seed 1, one worker, a 2-second per-run budget, and three repetitions. The 768-variable/1,408-constraint mixed fixture proved objective and bound `2688`; raw-solver medians were 7.7–17.6 ms and in-process worker medians were 8.4–19.4 ms. | Run `33582692427` at `d8c4317`; evidence is explicitly prebuilt-`CpModelProto`, in-process, excludes Rust translation/process spawn/full-adapter timing, and makes no product SLA claim |
| Static/dynamic linkage per target | **Selected: static OR-Tools on Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64, macOS arm64, and macOS x86_64.** Against shared OR-Tools, static reduced the measured worker-plus-installed-runtime-library payload by 33.3% on Linux, 23.7% on macOS arm64, and 25.9% on macOS x86_64, with equal or lower median process startup/loading samples and one fewer runtime file. Windows shared compilation fails in the pinned source at generated `assignment.pb.cc` with MSVC C2491; static is the viable mode. | Comparison run `33587339469` at `3a742b4`; selected-policy run `33590499388` at `a54df49`. This is static OR-Tools with the exact dependent-library set, not a claim that the complete worker process has no dynamic dependencies. |
| Target dependent-library loading | **Candidate closure confirmed; packaged clean-machine closure remains open.** All four selected targets passed architecture/dependency inspection and four worker spawn/runtime-loading/version-initialization/EOF-rejection launches. Selected candidate payloads were Linux 27,591,384 bytes/99 files, Windows 38,336,512 bytes/10 files, macOS arm64 28,605,488 bytes/99 files, and macOS x86_64 26,957,096 bytes/99 files. | Run `33590499388`; the launch samples explicitly exclude handshake, adapter, solve latency, calibrated cold-start, packaged-app behavior, and product SLA evidence. |
| Exact linked dependency licenses | **Candidate closure confirmed:** OR-Tools and Abseil `Apache-2.0`; protobuf `BSD-3-Clause`; bundled utf8_range `MIT`; RE2 `BSD-3-Clause`; zlib `Zlib`; bzip2 permissive `bzip2`. Eigen 3.4.0 is fetched under `EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY` but not compiled or linked with `USE_PDLP=OFF`. No GLPK, GPL/LGPL/AGPL, proprietary solver, or Python, Java, or .NET runtime dependency is compiled or linked. | Run `33577785073` inspected every installed runtime binary plus the worker and native test executable on all four targets; bzip2 resolved exactly to `66c46b8c9436613fd81bc5d03f63a61933a4dcc3`; production license payload/SBOM generation remains open |
| Worker SBOM/license manifest | **Open** | Phase 3 generation, Phase 11/12 exact-artifact inspection |
| Assumption/core APIs and callbacks | **Callback gate passed; sufficient-assumption capability remains disabled.** Every selected target emitted one fixed-feasible incumbent, zero infeasible incumbents, three strictly improving optimization incumbents, two strictly improving finite bounds ending at `2.6`, and one callback-stopped incumbent with `Feasible` termination. Issue #5141 remains open and the upstream keep-all workaround still reproduces. | Run `33590499388` at `a54df49`; callback evidence uses the direct OR-Tools API with seed 1 and one worker, and does not claim multi-worker behavior or deterministic worker-protocol event counts. Canonical handshake omits the assumption capability; reject any returned assumption evidence unless a later exact-build gate enables it. |

### K.4 — Pumpkin

| macOS x86_64 runner/support | **Native `macos-15-intel` Nix shell/source-build lane configured; successful run and signed-package smoke remain open** | Runner availability plus Phase 11/12 signed package smoke |
| Updater endpoint/signing-key lifecycle | **Open** | Protected endpoint/key custody/rotation/revocation tests |
| Standalone HTML supported browsers and PDF renderer | **Open**; one-file `file://`, zero-required-network, accessible interaction/list parity and controlled local PDF are required | Phase 07/09 implementation evidence; Phase 11 support statement; Phase 12 exact-candidate browser/platform/print/PDF gate |

### K.6 — AI adapters

| Gate | Status | Owner/closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Current official provider APIs | **Mutable/open at implementation and each release** | Phase 10 conformance against official OpenAI Responses/Chat compatibility, Anthropic Messages, and current Gemini contract |
| Tool schema/stream/event formats | **Open** | Recorded provider fixtures, normalization, malformed/stream tests |
| Local OpenAI-compatible differences | **Open** | Capability detection/warnings for strict mode, streaming, parallel calls, endpoint shapes |
| OS keyring on supported desktops/Linux fallback | **Open** | Credential create/read/replace/delete plus absent-daemon UX |
| First-public provider set | **Open** | Enable only adapters meeting maintenance/test quality; AI remains optional |

### K.7 — Domain semantics

| Gate | Status | Owner/closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Workforce defaults with practitioners | **Open until review** | Phase 5/12 research evidence |
| Fairness presets/weights | **Open until usability evidence** | Phase 5/7/12 |
| DST, rolling-hours, repair semantics | **Open until domain fixtures/review** | Phase 5/7/12 |
| Seating back-to-back classification | **Open until representative layouts** | Phase 9/12 |
| Accessibility seat metadata without unnecessary sensitive data | **Open until privacy/accessibility review** | Phase 9/12 |
| Non-authoritative legal/regulatory templates | **Permanent invariant; wording review open** | Phase 5/9/11/12 and future packs |

### K.8 — Release readiness

| Gate | Status before Phase 12 | Owner/closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Exact dependency licenses from locks/compiled artifacts | **Open** | Phase 11 exact notices/SBOM; Phase 12 review |
| No GPL/proprietary solver linked/bundled | **Open** | Exact binary/dependency inspection and solver manifests |
| Manual accessibility audit | **Open** | Phase 12 automated + keyboard/screen-reader/manual report |
| Clean-machine installer/update/uninstall | **Open** | Every declared target, exact digests |
| Publish source, notices, SBOM, checksums, signatures/attestations, migration notes | **Open until authorized release** | Phase 11 staging; Phase 12 publication/post-publish verification |

### K.9 — Transportation

The proposed official pack ID `official.transportation` is reserved for planning only and is not registered or implemented. Phase 14 is entered from completed Phase 12 independently of Phase 13 completion. Pack compilation and verification remain network-free and provider-neutral; only reviewed Rust application/infrastructure adapters may produce bounded immutable local snapshots. No calendar, routing, traffic, or transit provider is selected by this ledger.

| Gate | Status before Phase 14 implementation | Owner/closure evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ADRs for the external-data boundary, immutable snapshot schemas/versioning, network ownership, persistence/export semantics, and two-stage solve policy | **Open** | Phase 14 T0 approved ADRs and conformance contracts |
| Reference calendar, routing, and transit adapters plus each provider's API, authentication, licensing, rate, caching, retention, persistence, export, redistribution, and attribution terms | **Open; no provider selected** | Phase 14 T0 policy gates and T2/T3/T5 exact-provider reviews with bounded recorded conformance fixtures before an adapter is enabled |
| Least-privilege authentication/scopes, credential custody, revocation, account/tenant separation, and disclosed data access | **Open** | Phase 14 T0 threat model, authorization matrix, credential lifecycle tests, and consent UX |
| Routing capability for historical day/time traffic rather than live-current traffic alone, including provenance, freshness, determinism, and honest fallback labels | **Open** | Phase 14 T3 capability evidence and fixed snapshot fixtures; unsupported estimates are not advertised |
| Transit schedule/realtime data licensing, caching, redistribution, attribution, retention, and derived-snapshot rights | **Open** | Phase 14 T0/T5 exact-feed/provider legal review before transit support is enabled |
| Privacy threat model for calendars, precise locations, movement patterns, household relationships, minors, retention, logs, diagnostics, redaction, deletion, and export | **Open** | Phase 14 T0 security/privacy review and data-flow inventory |
| Proof that no-transit solve followed by opt-in transit fallback is bounded, cancellation-safe, never silently weakens required rules, and independently verifies every candidate accepted at either stage | **Open** | Phase 14 T5 deterministic orchestration tests, authoritative verifier evidence, and one shared budget |
| Practitioner review of terminology, required/default semantics, scoring priorities, transit opt-in, accessibility, explanations, and privacy-safe defaults | **Open** | Phase 14 T1/T7 recorded household/user research and approved default matrix |
| Candidate and benchmark limits for people, vehicles, commitments, locations, travel options, transit alternatives, horizon, solve stages, snapshot size/age, and global time/memory budget | **Open** | Phase 14 T0/T4/T7 published supported envelope, adversarial fixtures, and fixed-budget benchmark evidence |
| Manual entry and offline/stale-snapshot fallback, including explicit freshness/provenance, usable no-account behavior, safe refresh failure, and user-controlled snapshot persistence/export/deletion | **Open** | Phase 14 T2/T3/T6/T7 offline and provider-failure scenarios; core planning remains usable without a provider |

## Revalidation triggers

Re-run the relevant direct registry/API and official-contract checks before changing a lockfile/toolchain, starting a gated backend/provider/target branch, cutting beta/RC/stable, or after an upstream security/advisory notice. A revalidation updates this ledger and the owning phase evidence, never silently changes a recommendation. In particular:

- move from Rust 1.97.1 only after a fixed stable exists and passes affected builds/tests;
- move TypeScript to >=6.1 only after the selected typescript-eslint release declares support and lint/typecheck pass;
- change OR-Tools/protobuf only as one tested worker/protocol unit;
- change Pumpkin only with regenerated capability/cancellation/benchmark evidence;
- change provider contracts only with recorded conformance fixtures;
- change target/signing/updater assumptions only with clean-machine and key-lifecycle evidence;
- publish only when every K.8 row is closed against exact artifact digests.
