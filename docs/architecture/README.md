# Architecture

This directory summarizes the approved target architecture. The repository is in [Phase 00](../roadmap/00-repository-and-reproducible-tooling.md): it establishes reproducible tooling, legal and security policy, boundaries, and a minimal real desktop shell. It does **not** yet provide domain behavior, a solver worker, independent verification, an AI provider, an updater, or a production release. The [roadmap index](../roadmap/README.md) owns delivery order and detailed acceptance gates.

Dependency direction and ownership are normative in [dependency boundaries](dependency-boundaries.md). The central decisions are [ADR-001](../adr/001-core-library-and-cli.md), [ADR-006](../adr/006-solver-neutral-planning-ir.md), [ADR-007](../adr/007-independent-solution-verification.md), [ADR-012](../adr/012-tauri-api-and-generated-dtos.md), and [ADR-018](../adr/018-public-scenario-representation.md).

## Authority

Rust application services own authoritative scenario state, validation, transactions, persistence, routing, solving, projection, independent verification, scoring, explanations, and import/export. Tauri and the CLI are clients of those services. Vue/Pinia/query state is a presentation cache. A backend produces candidates, never trusted domain results. Optional AI can propose typed commands but is never persistence, solver, verifier, or routing authority.

## Planned solve data flow

The solve path is a contract for later phases, not a Phase-00 capability:

1. capture immutable scenario revision $R$;
2. domain-validate $R$;
3. deterministically compile solver-neutral planning IR plus provenance and projection;
4. normalize and validate the IR;
5. fingerprint it and route to an exactly compatible backend;
6. treat every backend event and candidate as untrusted;
7. project typed values to normalized domain assignments;
8. independently evaluate every required rule and recompute the authoritative score;
9. expose only verified candidates; and
10. atomically persist an accepted solution with its revision and reproducibility evidence.

A failed or cancelled solve never mutates the scenario. Persisting an accepted solution is a separate transaction after verification. [ADR-004](../adr/004-ortools-worker.md) defines worker isolation, and [ADR-008](../adr/008-mvp-solver-routing.md) defines routing and decomposition.

## State and external formats

SQLite is the planned local authority; OS credential storage alone holds credential values ([ADR-010](../adr/010-local-state-and-credentials.md)). Every mutation uses the typed command/journal contract ([ADR-011](../adr/011-command-journal-and-undo.md)). The public interchange contract is the versioned eutheto scenario document/bundle, never a backend model ([ADR-018](../adr/018-public-scenario-representation.md)).

All public scenario, bundle, database, command, event, schema, and worker-protocol formats require explicit versions and compatibility rules. Unknown newer versions fail safely. Canonical serialization and hashing require stable ordering and checked arithmetic. Contributor rules are in [generated code and contracts](../contributors/generated-code-and-contracts.md).

## Security boundaries

Imported documents/bundles, archive entries, worker frames, provider data, URLs, and future pack components are untrusted bounded inputs. Credentials never cross into Vue, SQLite, logs, exports, diagnostics, Nix derivations, or ordinary IPC. Tauri capabilities, the webview CSP, filesystem access, worker processes, OS credential storage, and release build/sign separation are explicit trust boundaries. See the [Phase-00 threat model](../threat-model.md).

## Change discipline

The numbered ADRs are approved decisions. They are not changed in place when the decision changes: a new numbered ADR must supersede the old record and add reciprocal links. Work pauses for an ADR when a backend needs domain knowledge, UI needs direct database access, AI needs arbitrary file/code/shell access, a plugin needs native in-process loading, decomposition cannot prove independence, migration cannot preserve supported scenarios, or packaging requires disabling a major security control.
