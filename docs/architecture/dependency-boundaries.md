# Dependency Boundaries

The canonical layer order is:

```text
presentation → thin Tauri adapter → application services → domain packs
             → planning core → backend adapters → infrastructure
```

Arrows describe allowed knowledge, not blanket permission to import every layer to the right. Interfaces remain at the inward boundary; infrastructure implements application-owned ports. The reusable Rust core and headless CLI rule is [ADR-001](../adr/001-core-library-and-cli.md).

## Layer rules

| Layer | May know | Must not know or do |
|---|---|---|
| Vue presentation | generated application DTOs, the desktop API facade, presentation-only state | Tauri primitives outside the API facade; SQLite/tables; credentials; domain mutation authority; solver or worker APIs |
| Thin Tauri adapter | generated DTOs, application-service interfaces, narrowly scoped native facilities | domain rules; planning compilation; solver construction; independent verification; broad filesystem/shell authority |
| CLI adapter | application-service interfaces, CLI serialization and exit policy | desktop/Tauri types; direct persistence mutation; backend-specific public formats |
| Application services | typed commands/queries, domain registry interfaces, persistence/process/credential ports | Vue components; ambient global mutable state; unvalidated direct provider/backend authority |
| Domain packs | domain API, stable value types, solver-neutral planning IR, normalized solution/verifier contracts | Tauri; SQLite; credential stores; network providers; OR-Tools; Pumpkin; backend objects; arbitrary HTML |
| Planning core and IR | typed solver-neutral primitives, capability/provenance/projection metadata | official domain-pack implementations; UI; database; provider clients; backend-native objects |
| Backend adapters | solver API, validated planning IR, worker/native solver interface | official domain packs; authoritative domain score or feasibility claims; persistence mutation |
| Independent verifier | original normalized domain scenario, normalized assignments, primitive independently tested facts | backend status as rule evidence; compiled backend constraints as the sole oracle |
| Infrastructure | application-owned persistence, filesystem, clock, process, network, and credential ports | domain policy; callers bypassing validation/transactions; secrets in ordinary responses |
| Optional AI adapter | bounded typed context, typed proposal/query contracts | database or credential access; arbitrary files, shell, code execution; solver/verifier/routing authority |

## Process and trust separation

The planned OR-Tools path crosses a versioned worker protocol into one supervised child per solve. The worker receives numeric/stable model identifiers rather than names, notes, credentials, AI content, or unrelated paths. Frames are length/count bounded and validated before use. A worker exit, mismatch, malformed response, timeout, or cancellation returns a typed failure and cannot mutate scenario state. See [ADR-004](../adr/004-ortools-worker.md).

A future in-process Pumpkin adapter is explicitly experimental and must satisfy dedicated-thread, cancellation, panic, compatibility, packaging, and benchmark gates before its label can change ([ADR-005](../adr/005-pumpkin-experimental-backend.md)). A future third-party pack boundary is sandboxed WASM/components, never native dynamic libraries ([ADR-009](../adr/009-domain-pack-loading.md)). Neither is a Phase-00 capability.

## Data ownership rules

- Stable typed IDs are identity; display names, array positions, and database row IDs are not.
- Scenario mutation is typed, validated, transactional, revision-checked, durable, and reversible when semantics permit.
- Solves read immutable revisions. Results retain their source revision and are explicitly stale after relevant edits.
- Public formats are versioned and do not reuse fields or tags with changed meaning.
- Imported content is parsed and migrated fully before one atomic commit.
- Canonical work uses stable ordering and checked integer arithmetic.
- Hidden global mutable state is forbidden.
- `unsafe` is forbidden in normal project crates. A narrow exception requires an isolated safety module, documented invariants, dedicated tests, and maintainer review.

## Enforcement contract

Phase 00 establishes these checks as repository policy; automation must fail closed as the relevant crates and packages appear:

- Rust dependency policy rejects layer reversals and cyclic crate dependencies.
- Frontend linting rejects Tauri invoke/event imports outside `apps/desktop/src/api`.
- The generation drift check rejects hand-edited or stale DTO/schema/protocol outputs.
- Source policy rejects `unsafe` in normal crates unless the documented exception is reviewed.
- Architecture checks reject hidden global mutable state patterns rather than allowing undocumented exceptions.
- CODEOWNERS review applies to parsers/untrusted inputs, worker protocol, credentials, updater/signing, cryptography, and Tauri capabilities.

An absent future crate is not proof that its behavior exists; a check becomes executable with the owning phase and must not be replaced by a no-op. The [roadmap](../roadmap/README.md#global-invariants-and-stop-conditions) remains the delivery authority.
